** Publishing
*** Spacemacs
    1. Access a file, for example ~./src/index.org~.
    2. Use ~<space> m e e P p~ to publish the project. The output will be in the ~public~ folder.
** Troubleshooting
   If you're facing problems with publishing, do the following to do a clean publish.
   1. Run ~rm -rf ./public/~ to clear the published directory.
   2. Run ~rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/.cache/.org-timestamps/~ to clear the org cache.
** Running
   When porting old posts, I used this script:
   #+begin_src elisp
     (defun create-old-post (date name)
       (find-file (concat (projectile-project-root) "src/posts/" date (downcase (replace-regexp-in-string " +" "-" name)) ".org"))
       (insert "#+INCLUDE: \"../../../../options/default-config.org\"\n")
       (insert (format "#+SUBTITLE: %s\n\n" name))
     )
   #+end_src
** Hack
   This involves some ugly hacks namely removing the ~file-name-absolute-p~ check from the ~when~ block in line 3088 in ~ox-html.org~ inside the ~org-html-link~ to get internal references working.
