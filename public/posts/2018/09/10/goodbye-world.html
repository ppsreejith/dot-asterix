Okay, so this is technically a hello world post but I thought it would be a good idea to play around with the wording.
</p>

<p>
I'll be joining GoJek in about a week where I expect to learn a great many things. I hope to document my learning process so as to both share my experiences as well as serve as a public immutable journal of what my thoughts were at a particular point in time. Ofcourse, this will only work if I keep this blog updated which I will try to do.
</p>

<p>
Aside from that, I'll also throw in a bit of book reviews and updates on my (non tech included) hobbies and interests.
